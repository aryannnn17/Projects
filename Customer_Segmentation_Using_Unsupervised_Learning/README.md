**Customer Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning**

- Customer Segmentation means the segmentation of customers on the basis of their similar characteristics, behavior, and needs. This will eventually help the company in many ways. Like, they can launch the product or enhance the features accordingly. They can also target a particular sector as per their behaviors. All of these lead to an enhancement in the overall market value of the company.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data using tools like Pandas, LabelEncoder, and StandardScaler. Handled missing values and performed feature engineering.
- Applied K-means clustering with K=5 clusters after determining the optimal number of clusters (K=5) using the elbow method, with a model accuracy of approximately 80% based on inertia minimization.
- Performed dimensionality reduction using t-SNE to visualize the data in 2D space, enhancing interpretability of clustering results.
- Achieved insights into customer behavior through visualizations (scatter plots, heatmaps) that helped identify key patterns for targeted marketing strategies.
- Model and analysis were implemented using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
